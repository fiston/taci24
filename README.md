## End Points

This API endpoints are sub-divided in 4 points:

* [/drivers] which handles all that has to do with the drivers
* [/driver-shift] Which handles the Drivers' shifts
* [/rider] which handles riders
* [trip] that takes care of all trips

Every endpoint has sub-end point which add, display and edit. We don't allow delete in our API for audit and historical data purpose.
